# film.map1

## What module is about
This module is created to solve a problem of nearest location. 
You have a list of films, year when film was created and current user location. You need to find 10(or less) nearest spots where movies by specific year were filmed. 
Visualise your results with Folium package using 3(or more) different layers.


## Map information
Our map has 3 layers. They are created to sort information you see. Also you can change your background and layers using item in your right up corner.

First is marking user current position with home marker.
